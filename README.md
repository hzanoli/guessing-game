# guessing-game

##Game rules:

1) Three players play the game. Each player plays a sequentially (A -> B-> C) a number between 0 and 1.

2) The players cannot repeat the numbers

3) A random number n (between 0 and 1) is chosen randomly. The player which has chosen the closest to n wins the game.

##In order to solve if, assume:

i) All the players play optimally

ii) Their sole goal is to maximise their chances of winning (they do not care about the changes of the other players)

ii) In case a more than one number is the optimal case the player will play ramdomly one of the optimal choices


##Questions:
a) What is the best choice for the first player?
b) How to solve this problem for the case with N players?
